# 📝 TL;DR Generator for Markdown Files

This script automatically generates a "Too Long; Didn't Read" (TL;DR) summary for Markdown files and injects it into the file. It uses Google's Gemini AI to generate the summaries.

## 🚀 Why This Script Exists

Providing a TL;DR section at the beginning of a long blog post or documentation page can significantly improve user experience. Readers can quickly grasp the main points of the content before deciding to read the entire text. This script automates the process of creating and adding these summaries.

## 🛠️ Features

*   Recursively finds all `.md` files in a given directory.
*   Uses Google's Gemini API to generate a concise TL;DR summary.
*   Injects the generated TL;DR into the Markdown file.
*   Skips files that already contain a TL;DR summary.
*   Can process a single file, a directory, or the entire blog.

## 📦 Requirements

*   **Docker:** The script is designed to run in a Docker container to ensure a consistent environment.
*   **Gemini API Key:** You need a Gemini API key to use the AI-powered summary generation.

## 🐳 Docker Usage

1.  **Set up your Gemini API Key:**

    Create a `.env` file at the root of your project with the following content:

    ```dotenv
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
    ```

2.  **Run the script in a Docker container:**

    Open a terminal at the root of your project and run the following command to start a shell inside a Docker container:

    ```bash
    docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/app -w /app python sh -c "pip install google-genai python-dotenv  > /dev/null 2>&1 && /bin/bash"
    ```

3.  **Execute the script:**

    Inside the container's shell, run the script with the path to the Markdown file or directory you want to process.

    **Examples:**

    *   **Process the entire blog directory:**

        ```bash
        python .scripts/python_tldr/main.py blog/
        ```

    *   **Process all posts from a specific year (e.g., 2026):**

        ```bash
        python .scripts/python_tldr/main.py blog/2026/
        ```

    *   **Process all posts from a specific month (e.g., January 2026):**

        ```bash
        python .scripts/python_tldr/main.py blog/2026/01/
        ```

    *   **Process a single blog post:**

        ```bash
        python .scripts/python_tldr/main.py blog/2026/01/some-post.md
        ```

## 🧪 Output

The script will provide real-time feedback in the console, indicating the status of each file:

*   `✅ [File Name]: Injected successfully.` - The TL;DR was successfully generated and injected.
*   `⚠️  [File Name]: SKIPPED (Exists)` - The file already has a TL;DR section.
*   `❌ [File Name]: ERROR: [Error Message]` - An error occurred during the process.

At the end of the execution, a summary of the batch process is displayed.
