"""
Script to Externalize Inline Code Snippets from Markdown Files

This utility processes multiple Markdown files, identifies code blocks enclosed
within custom <Snippet> tags, extracts the code content, and saves it to
separate files in a dedicated 'files/' subdirectory relative to the Markdown file.

Key Features:
1. Extracts code content from the Markdown file and saves it to a file named
   after the <Snippet filename="..."> attribute.
2. Creates the 'files/' subdirectory only if there is code to externalize.
3. Automatically handles path placeholders in 'filename' (e.g., /tmp/config.txt -> config.txt).
4. Resolves naming conflicts by appending '.part2', '.part3', etc., to the externalized file.
5. Replaces the original <Snippet>...</Snippet> block with a self-closing tag
   <Snippet filename="..." source="./files/..." /> pointing to the new file.
6. Ignores snippets targeting files with a '.md' extension to prevent externalizing Markdown into Markdown.

Usage:
1. Save this code as 'externalize_snippets.py'.
2. Set the 'markdown_files_pattern' variable to target your documentation files.
3. Run the script: python externalize_snippets.py
