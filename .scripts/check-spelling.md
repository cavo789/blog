# Documentation: Spelling & Grammar Checker

## Overview

The `check-spelling.sh` script is a localized quality assurance tool designed for the `cavo789/blog`. It leverages the **LanguageTool** API running in a Docker container to identify linguistic errors in Markdown files.

## Technical Architecture

1. **Source:** The script crawls the `blog/` directory using `globstar`.
2. **Transport:** Content is streamed via `curl` using `POST` requests.
3. **Processing:** The `languagetool` service (Java-based) analyzes the text against n-gram datasets.
4. **Reporting:** `jq` filters the raw JSON response to highlight specific line offsets and error messages.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Docker** | The `languagetool` service must be active in `compose.yaml`. |
| **Connectivity** | Accessible at `http://languagetool:8010/v2/check` (internal network). |
| **CLI Tools** | `curl` for requests and `jq` for JSON manipulation. |

## How to Use

Run `make devcontainer` to start the development container with Docker Compose. Then open a terminal in the `blog` service and execute: `.scripts/check-spelling.sh`

This will analyze all Markdown files in the `blog/` directory and output any detected spelling or grammar issues along with their line numbers and suggestions.
