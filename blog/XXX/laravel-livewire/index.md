![Laravel Livewire](/img/laravel_tips_header.jpg)

[Laravel Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com/) is just like VueJs (or React) but coded in PHP.

Livewire is based on the AlpineJs framework.

We'll use `php artisan` commands for building what Livewire call a `component` f.i. `php artisan make:livewire counter` (see more [https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/quickstart#writing-the-class](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/quickstart#writing-the-class)).

## Laravel Wiretap

Wiretap is dev tools for Livewire.

Once included (with `composer`), press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> to show/hide the panel in the browser window.
