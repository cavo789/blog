![JSON - Online linter](./images/json_lint_banner.jpg)

Exactly like my [SQL - Formatting tool](/blog/sql-formatter), it's always useful to have a tool in your favourites that lets you copy/paste a JSON character string and display it as a treeview with or without code folding feature.

I use it quite regularly when I'm writing a JSON string and I want to check that there are no syntax errors (lint) or, on the other hand, and for example, when I call an API that returns JSON and I want to analyse the code received.  In these cases, the collapse functionality comes in very handy.

Retrieve my **JSON Linter** tool and sources on [https://github.com/cavo789/jsonlint](https://github.com/cavo789/jsonlint).

The tool is accessible online: [https://jsonlint.avonture.be/](https://jsonlint.avonture.be/)
