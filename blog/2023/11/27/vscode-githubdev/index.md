![Start vscode from github.com](/img/v2/vscode_tips.webp)

It's not something new, but it's probably not known well enough: by browsing **any** GitHub repository like e.g. [https://github.com/cavo789/blog](https://github.com/cavo789/blog), you can just press <kbd>.</kbd> (the dot key) on your keyboard to start VS Code online to see the current repository in vscode.dev.

Here is the blog in vscode.dev: [https://github.dev/cavo789/blog](https://github.dev/cavo789/blog).

You can achieve the same result by updating the URL and changing the `.com` extension to `.dev`

## But what's the point? Why would I need it

Imagine you are not at home, on your own computer, and you want to change your repository?

But also that you are on a bus/train/plane and want to correct a typo you've just seen.

You may also want to make a very small update like changing your readme.md file. It is really faster to do online than having to clone/update the project on your computer, make the change, add/commit/push it.

Just browse to your repository using your smartphone, nothing more than using a basic web browser, change the extension to `.dev` and bingo, you can start editing your repository (or the one of someone else if you want to suggest a Pull request (aka a `PR`)).
