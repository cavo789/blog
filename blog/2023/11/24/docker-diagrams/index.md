But what a joy it is to be able to draw diagrams by, well, just writing text. Some tools are better known than others, e.g. [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/).

Did you know [https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/)? Let's explore it using, of course, a Docker ready-to-use image.

<!-- truncate -->

Take a look on the different examples you can retrieve on [https://github.com/mingrammer/diagrams](https://github.com/mingrammer/diagrams).

Like always, for the demo, please start a Linux shell and run `mkdir -p /tmp/docker-diagrams && cd $_` to create a folder called `java` in your Linux temporary folder and jump in it.

Please create a new file called `team.py` with this content:

<Snippet filename="team.py" source="./files/team.py" />

To run the conversion, go back to your console and run the following command:

<Terminal>
$ cat team.py | docker run -i --rm -v $(pwd):/out -u 1000:1000 gtramontina/diagrams:0.23.3
</Terminal>

<AlertBox variant="note" title="Windows notation">
If you're working Windows, replace `$(pwd)` by `%CD%`. And replace `cat` by `type`.

</AlertBox>

And bingo, the script is converted to the image here below:

![Team](./images/team.jpg)

*0.23.3 is the latest version available when writing this document. See [https://hub.docker.com/r/gtramontina/diagrams/tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/gtramontina/diagrams/tags) to retrieve the latest one.*

Easy no?

Another example:

<Snippet filename="app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php" source="./files/EventServiceProvider.php" />

And the resulting image:

![Stateful Architecture](./images/stateful_architecture.jpg)

Crazy no? And all without installing anything!

<AlertBox variant="info" title="More example">

## Icons (called Nodes)

A tremendous list of icons/nodes is available on multiple pages at [https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/docs/nodes/onprem](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/docs/nodes/onprem). See [OnPrem](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/docs/nodes/onprem), [AWS](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/docs/nodes/aws), [Azure](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/docs/nodes/azure), [GCP](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/docs/nodes/gcp), [IBM](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/docs/nodes/ibm), [K8S](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/docs/nodes/k8s), ... and also how to create our owns (using local `.png` images): [Custom](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/docs/nodes/custom).
