![Bash - ASCII art](/img/v2/ascii_art.webp)

I write a lot of Bash scripts, and I like to have a similar approach for each one. One of the things I always do is to include a good old-fashioned *ASCII Art* banner, perhaps for the geek factor, but mostly to make a bigger visual impact.

I use [https://patorjk.com/software/taag](https://patorjk.com/software/taag) to create my banners, so let's take a closer look.

On my hand, I'm implementing the banner like this:

<Snippet filename="script.sh" source="./files/script.sh" />

And this is how it'll look like in my bash terminal:
