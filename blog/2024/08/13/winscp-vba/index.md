[WinSCP](https://winscp.net/) is a free, open-source file manager for securely transferring files between your computer and remote servers using protocols like SFTP, FTP, SCP, and WebDAV.

Did you know that you can call WinSCP from ... VBA code?

See [https://winscp.net/eng/docs/library_vb#using](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/library_vb#using). There are also several posts in the forum: [https://winscp.net/forum/search.php?mode=results](https://winscp.net/forum/search.php?mode=results)

<!-- truncate -->

The [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/) DLLs can be called up through a VBA code and therefore it would be possible to upload / download a file to / from an FTP server.

Below a simple VBA example you can use in f.i. MS Excel to upload a file to your remote server.

```vbnet
Option Explicit

Sub Example()

    Dim mySession As New Session

    ' Enable custom error handling
    On Error Resume Next

    Upload mySession

    ' Query for errors
    If Err.Number <> 0 Then
        MsgBox "Error: " & Err.Description

        ' Clear the error
        Err.Clear
    End If

    ' Disconnect, clean up
    mySession.Dispose

    ' Restore default error handling
    On Error GoTo 0

End Sub

Private Sub Upload(ByRef mySession As Session)

    ' Setup session options
    Dim mySessionOptions As New SessionOptions
    With mySessionOptions
        .Protocol = Protocol_Sftp
        .HostName = "example.com"
        .UserName = "user"
        .Password = "mypassword"
        .SshHostKeyFingerprint = "ssh-rsa 2048 xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx"
    End With

    ' Connect
    mySession.Open mySessionOptions

    ' Upload files
    Dim myTransferOptions As New TransferOptions
    myTransferOptions.TransferMode = TransferMode_Binary

    Dim transferResult As TransferOperationResult
    Set transferResult = mySession.PutFiles("c:\temp\*", "/home/user/", False, myTransferOptions)

    ' Throw on any error
    transferResult.Check

    ' Display results
    Dim transfer As TransferEventArgs
    For Each transfer In transferResult.Transfers
        MsgBox "Upload of " & transfer.Filename & " succeeded"
    Next

End Sub
```
