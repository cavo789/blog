![Restore a Joomla backup using Docker](/img/v2/joomla.webp)

<TLDR>
  This guide explains how to restore a Joomla site locally by combining Docker,
  an Akeeba Backup archive, and the Akeeba Kickstart utility. Users configure a
  custom environment with PHP and Apache, then execute a simple import command
  to deploy the necessary files and containers. The process is completed by
  accessing the Kickstart wizard in a browser to finalize the database
  connection and site restoration.
</TLDR>

In previous articles ([Part 1](/blog/docker-joomla) and [Part 2](/blog/docker-joomla-part-2)), we've seen how to create a Joomla site from scratch by using Docker: pull Joomla, PHP, Apache and MySQL from Docker Hub and do magic stuff so we have a fresh `http://127.0.0.1:8080` local site.

In this article, we'll see how to restore on our machine, a backup created thanks to great **[Akeeba Backup](https://www.akeeba.com/products/akeeba-backup.html)** component.

We'll reuse some files from [Part 2](/blog/docker-joomla-part-2) and make some changes to them.

At the end, we'll have a `make import` command that will start **[Akeeba Kickstart](https://www.akeeba.com/download.html#kickstart)**.

## Creating required files

<AlertBox variant="info" title="Skipping the files creation process">
In the next chapters, you'll need to create several files using copy/paste. If you wish go faster, just run the following commands to retrieve files from my [Github repo](https://github.com/cavo789/docker_joomla_restore) so you don't need to create them.

<Terminal>
  $ mkdir /tmp/joomla_restore && cd $_ $ curl -LOJ --silent
  https://github.com/cavo789/docker_joomla_restore/archive/refs/tags/1.0.0.tar.gz
  $ tar -xzvf docker_joomla_restore-1.0.0.tar.gz --strip-components 1 && rm -f
  docker_joomla_restore-1.0.0.tar.gz $ tar -xzvf docker_joomla_restore.gz
  --strip-components 1 && rm -f docker_joomla_restore.gz
</Terminal>

By following the instructions below, you'll create a xxx folder where you can copy all the files you need to restore a Joomla site using Docker. You can then proceed immediately to the “Run the import process” chapter, as the files are already in place.

</AlertBox>

_If you prefer to understand what you do and create files manually, please continue your lecture here below._

Please create a new folder on your computer like f.i. `mkdir /tmp/joomla_restore && cd $_`.

<Terminal>$ mkdir /tmp/joomla_restore && cd $_</Terminal>

In that folder, you'll need to create several files (please refer to [Part 2](/blog/docker-joomla-part-2)) if you need more explanations about these files.

### The orchestration file: compose.yaml

Below, highlighted, small differences from the `compose.yaml` file we saw in [Part 2](/blog/docker-joomla-part-2#updated-composeyaml).

Here is why: this time we don't need to download a fresh copy of Joomla since **we already have a Joomla site** (our backup). What we need is **PHP** and **Apache**. We don't need Joomla so, this time, we'll use a custom Docker image; not a already existing one.

Except highlighted lines, all the rest is the same that in [Part 2](/blog/docker-joomla-part-2).

<Snippet filename="compose.yaml" source="./files/compose.yaml" />

### The .env file

As introduced above; we don't need Joomla anymore but just PHP and Apache. We'll then define a `PHP_VERSION` variable and initialise it to the desired version.

<Snippet filename=".env" source="./files/.env" />

<AlertBox variant="caution" title="">
Since we need to restore an existing site, make sure to use the same PHP version than the one used by your site.

</AlertBox>

### Our makefile

We'll need a new action called `import`:

<Snippet filename="makefile" source="./files/makefile" />

<AlertBox variant="caution" title="">
If you don't know if you already have `GNU make`, just run `which make` in the console. If you see `make not found` then please run `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install make` to proceed the installation.

<Terminal>$ which make</Terminal>

<Terminal>$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install make</Terminal>

</AlertBox>

### We also need a file called Dockerfile

In the very first lines of the `compose.yaml` file we've this portion:

<Snippet filename="compose.yaml" source="./files/compose_dockerfile.yaml" />

We don't see here an `image:` statement but a `build:` one. This means that we need a special file called `Dockerfile`.

Please create a new file called `Dockerfile` in your folder with this content:

<Snippet filename="Dockerfile" source="./files/Dockerfile" />

That file is quite simple right now: it tells we need a PHP Docker image, and we also need to install the `mysqli` drivers.

### We need a backup for sure

Please also put a backup of your existing site and save it in the same folder. For standardisation needs, please call that file `backup.jpa`.

To make this step more explicit: jump to your existing Joomla website and, using Akeeba Backup, create a backup (file format: `.jpa`) and download the backup. Please rename the backup file like this: `backup.jpa`.

### And finally, we need Akeeba Kickstart

Finally, we also need to have two files coming from **[Akeeba Kickstart](https://www.akeeba.com/download.html#kickstart)**.

By following the link [Akeeba Kickstart](https://www.akeeba.com/download.html#kickstart), we'll be able to download a `.zip` file (called `kickstart-core-xxx.zip` where `xxx` is a version number). Proceed to the download and open the archives: we'll get two files in it. Please copy these files in your folder.

The two files we need are called `en-GB.kickstart.ini` and `kickstart.php`.

## Before starting

We're ready. Just before you begin, please check that you have all the required files (please run `ls -alh`):

<Terminal>
$ ls -alh

</Terminal>

<AlertBox variant="info" title="Skipping the files creation process">
If you've skipped file's creation earlier by downloading files from my repo; you'll have all the files listed here above.

</AlertBox>

<AlertBox variant="caution" title="">
Remember, for Linux users, we need `GNU make` to be able to run commands like `make import` or `make up`. If you see `make not found` then please run `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install make` to proceed the installation.

</AlertBox>

## Run the importation process

Ok, you've copied a lot of files. Time to start restoring your site.

For Linux users, simply take advantage of `GNU Make` and run the `make import` instruction.

For Windows (Powershell or DOS), please run these commands:

<Terminal title="Powershell">
  mkdir db_data mkdir joomla_data copy en-GB.kickstart.ini joomla_data\ copy
  kickstart.php joomla_data\ copy backup.jpa joomla_data\ docker compose up
  --detach
</Terminal>

For both users (Linux and Windows), you'll something like this output in the console:

<Terminal>

</Terminal>

When finished, just start your browser and surf to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/kickstart.php` to start the restoration of your website using the **Akeeba Kickstart** wizard.

![Akeeba Kickstart](./images/kickstart.webp)

Once you'll need to fill in the database information's, please refer to what was displayed in your console:

![Restoring the database](./images/database.webp)

Continue restoration as you always have; close the window once Akeeba Kickstart ask for, then click on the _Clean Up_ button; then on _Visit your site's frontend_ and enjoy:

![Site is restored](./images/site_is_restored.webp)

<AlertBox variant="info" title="">
If you've used the provided demo site, the admin account is **joomla** and his password is **joomla@secured**.

</AlertBox>

## Conclusion

As we've just seen, restoring a Joomla site locally has become really simple.

All you need to do is retrieve a few configuration files, and just the one named `.env` should be updated with the PHP and MySQL versions you're using on your production site.

You download the local backup of your site and, with a single command (`make import`), your site is restored.

<Terminal>$ make import</Terminal>

No matter what version of Joomla or MySQL you're using.

Piece of cake, no?
