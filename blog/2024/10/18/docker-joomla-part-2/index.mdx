![Create your Joomla website using Docker - Part 2](/img/v2/joomla.webp)

<!--cspell:ignore runningjoomlaindocker, mysqli -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD010 MD026 -->

At the end of 2023, I wrote a very long post about using Joomla with Docker: [Create your Joomla website using Docker - Part 1](/blog/docker-joomla).

It was a step-by-step introduction to Docker and the creation of a local Joomla-based website.

I explained, at length, the various steps involved in creating a website, choosing a database engine (MySQL, MariaDB or PostgreSQL), choosing a specific version of Joomla / database engine, the type of volumes (should the site and database be kept in RAM or on the hard disk (i.e. the notion of volumes)) and many other things such as choosing the port for the website, creating an alias (something like `http://my_project.local` instead of `http://127.0.0.1`). I strongly urge you to read or re-read this article before starting this one.

<AlertBox variant="caution" title="">
Here is the link to that article : [Create your Joomla website using Docker - Part 1](/blog/docker-joomla).

</AlertBox>

As Docker and Joomla are evolving rapidly, I propose here to start from where we were and see what has changed since then.

We're also going to take automation a step further, making much greater use of the concept of `makefile` and a configuration file called `.env`.

<!-- truncate -->

## Prerequisites

In contrast to article [Create your Joomla website using Docker - Part 1](/blog/docker-joomla), where I began by explaining down a few concepts before moving on to discuss the subject, let's do the opposite here: let's start with the three files we are going to use, and then see how they work. Please don't try too hard to understand the contents of the files; we'll come back to that later.

Create the three files in a folder on your hard disk for the time being (f.i. in `/tmp/joomla`), so that we can quickly get to the heart of the matter: creating a Joomla site with just one line of commands to run on your computer.

### Our orchestration file: compose.yaml

We need a file that will explain to Docker how we want to configure Joomla and, also, the type of database we want.

Our orchestration file will also inform Docker that we want the Joomla site to be persistent, i.e. the files to be saved on our hard disk. The same applies to the database.

We need to do this so that, if we voluntarily **remove** the Docker container to release memory f.i., we want that the Joomla website is saved on disk. So, next time we will wake **up** our site, files and database tables will be restored.

<AlertBox variant="info" title="Persistence">
There are two types of persistence, the one managed natively by Docker (*intern volumes*) or the one where we'll see the files in our project's folder (*mounted volumes*). We'll opt for the latter. See my article [Using volumes with Docker, use cases](/blog/docker-volumes) if you want to learn more.

</AlertBox>

We're also going to define a dependency (based on `depends_on` and `healthcheck`): Joomla must wait for the database server to be ready before starting its installation (in fact, if the Joomla installer tries to access MySQL before the system is even loaded, our project will crash during container loading).

As you can see, our `compose.yaml` file is of tremendous importance for the proper definition of our project.

<AlertBox variant="note" title="">
In recent months, the name of the file to be used has changed from `compose.yaml` to `compose.yaml`; still supported for now, but might as well use the new name. See [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/compose/intro/compose-application-model/#the-compose-file) if you want more info about this change.

</AlertBox>

Please create a new folder (f.i. `mkdir /tmp/joomla && cd $_`) on your hard disk and create the `compose.yaml` file with this content:

<Terminal>$ mkdir /tmp/joomla && cd $_</Terminal>

<Snippet filename="compose.yaml" source="./files/compose.yaml" />

### We'll use a configuration file called .env

We're also going to use a configuration file named `.env` (which is never anything more than a silly dictionary of keys - values) to differentiate our projects.

Please create a second file called `.env` with this content:

<Snippet filename=".env" source="./files/.env" />

Using a `.env` file is really useful to no more do changes to the `compose.yaml` file which can be standard in all your projects.

If you need two or more Joomla websites (you're a web agency starting to use Docker for your development), you'll be able to only do changes to the `.env` file by updating the `WEB_PORT` (each project should have his unique port) and, you'll probably update the `PROJECT_NAME` too to f.i. your customer name.

<AlertBox variant="info" title="">
`WEB_PORT`, `PROJECT_NAME`, ... are just *variables*. If you look back to your just copied/pasted `compose.yaml` content, you'll retrieve these variables like on the line `image: joomla:${JOOMLA_VERSION:-latest}`.

The `${XXX:-yyy}` syntax means: if the variable exists, use it (the `XXX` part) otherwise use a default value (the `yyy` part).

So, here, if `JOOMLA_VERSION` exists and this is the case in our `.env` file, then use his value. We'll then use `image: joomla:5.2.0-php8.3-apache`. If `JOOMLA_VERSION` was missing in our `.env`, then we'll use `latest` and thus `image: joomla:latest`.

</AlertBox>

### Let's make our lives simpler and lazier; using a makefile

The third and last file we'll use is being called `makefile` and that file will contain some _scripts_ i.e. we'll create a script called `up` for building our website.

To be able to use a `makefile`, you should have `GNU Make` binary installed on your machine.

<AlertBox variant="caution" title="">
If you don't know if you already have `GNU make`, just run `which make` in the console. If you see `make not found` then please run `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install make` to proceed the installation.

<Terminal>$ which make</Terminal>

<Terminal>$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install make</Terminal>

</AlertBox>

So, please create a file called `makefile` in your current directory with this content:

<Snippet filename="makefile" source="./files/makefile" />

<AlertBox
  variant="highlyImportant"
  title="Indentation should be TAB not spaces"
>
  It's terribly vicious because it's totally silent: the indentation in a
  makefile must be tabs, not spaces. When you copy/paste the above code to
  create your file, make sure your text editor uses tabs. If it doesn't, the
  commands defined in the file won't work.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox variant="note" title="">
If you want to learn more about GNU Make, check my [Linux Makefile - When to use a makefile](/blog/makefile-using-make) article

</AlertBox>

## Before starting

We're ready. Just before you begin, please check that you have the three files below (please run `ls -alh`):

<ProjectSetup folderName="/tmp/joomla" createFolder={true}>
  <Guideline>
    Now, please run 'UID=$(id -u) GID=$(id -g) docker compose up --detach' to
    create your Joomla site. Wait a few and open your browser, surf to
    http://localhost:8080 to open your Joomla site. The database type should be
    `MySQLi`, the name of the host should be `joomladb`, the username should be
    `root` and the password for that user should be `example`.
  </Guideline>
  <Snippet filename=".env" source="./files/.env" />
  <Snippet filename="compose.yaml" source="./files/compose.yaml" />
  <Snippet filename="makefile" source="./files/makefile" />
</ProjectSetup>

<Terminal>
$ ls -alh

total 20K
drwxr-xr-x 2 christophe christophe 4.0K Jan 4 16:10 .
drwxrwxrwt 13 root root 4.0K Jan 4 16:10 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 christophe christophe 201 Jan 4 16:10 .env
-rw-r--r-- 1 christophe christophe 1.2K Jan 4 16:10 compose.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 christophe christophe 1.6K Jan 4 16:10 makefile

</Terminal>

### Check our configuration

By running `make config` (`config` is an action we've defined in our `makefile`), we can display the configuration of our project on the screen _(just display, nothing is fired)_.

<Terminal>$ make config</Terminal>

We should see a lot of technical information starting with something like:

<Snippet source="./files/make_config.yaml" />

<AlertBox variant="info" title="">
The output here above is a **partial content** and just show the first lines displayed to the console by the `make config` command.

</AlertBox>

The objective of `make config` is to make sure that all files are correct (otherwise we'll get error messages) and that variables are well replaced by their values. You can see f.i. that the Joomla version is well the one we've specified in the `.env` file and the user line (the last line here above) is correctly initialised to the **user_id:group_id** of your current user.

<AlertBox variant="info" title="UID/GID">
The **user_id:group_id** will vary depending on your own configuration. It'll be `1000:1000` in the most situations, but this can be something else when, f.i., you've defined more than one user in your Linux distribution; the first user probably be `1000:1000`, the second `1001:1001` and so on.

</AlertBox>

## Let's wake up Joomla...

Here we are at the heart of the subject: we would like to see a beautiful, fresh Joomla site. Is it possible to do this in a single command and even without having to install anything by hand?

The answer is "Yes" and `make up` will do the magic.

In your console, just run `make up`, and please wait one minute. The very first time, you'll get something like this in your console:

<Terminal>
$ make up

UID=$(id -u) GID=$(id -g) docker compose up --detach
[+] Running 33/12
✔ joomla Pulled 16.1s
✔ joomladb Pulled 10.7s

[+] Running 3/3
✔ Network runningjoomlaindocker_default Created 0.0s
✔ Container joomla-db Healthy 31.7s
✔ Container joomla-app Started 31.1s

</Terminal>

What does that mean? Docker has retrieved (_pulled_) from the Internet our `joomla` and `joomladb` services (in other terms, has downloaded the Joomla CMS (including PHP and Apache) and MySQL).

By running then command below (or just `docker container list` to get all the columns), you'll get the list of running containers:

<Terminal>
$ {`docker container list --all --format "table {{.Image}}\\t{{.Names}}\\t{{.Status}}\\t{{.Ports}}"`}

IMAGE NAMES STATUS PORTS
joomla:5.2.0-php8.3-apache joomla-app Up 6 minutes 0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp
mysql:8.4.2 joomla-db Up 7 minutes (healthy) 3306/tcp, 33060/tcp

</Terminal>

As we can see, yay!, we have our two services (named containers) which are Joomla and MySQL, and they are both _Up_ (see the `Status` column). We see that Joomla uses port `8080` and MySQL uses port `3306`.

<AlertBox variant="info" title="">
The port `8080` is the one we've specified in our `.env` (variable `WEB_PORT`) and, the same for MySQL, it uses port `3006` because that's the one we defined (`MYSQL_PORT`).

Note that `3306` is the standard port for MySQL.

</AlertBox>

<AlertBox variant="info" title="Hey! did you notice?">
We've created our Joomla website by **just running one command**. Don't trust? Open your browser and surf to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

</AlertBox>

### ... or let's ask him to fall asleep (keep containers)

The opposite command to `make up` is `make stop`. The `stop` action will stop our Joomla and MySQL containers (read `make them sleeping`) but without removing files (your site and your database) from your hard drive. By running `make up` again, you'll retrieve them. `up` and `stop` are like a light switch.

<Terminal>$ make stop</Terminal>

### ... or let's ask him to remove containers (free more memory)

The `make down` command will stop the containers as well remove them. But in our case, we'll still have files on our hard disk so we'll not lose our website.

<Terminal>$ make down</Terminal>

### ... or let's ask him to suicide (remove containers and files)

The `make reset` command will stop containers but, too, remove files on the disk.

<Terminal>$ make reset</Terminal>

<AlertBox variant="danger" title="">
By running `make reset`, you'll lose everything and be ready to create a new fresh website.

</AlertBox>

## Getting access to Docker logs

Sometimes, if something goes wrong, it's nice to have access to the Docker logs. Simply run `make log` to achieve this.

<Terminal>$ make log</Terminal>

Logs will look like this:

<!-- cspell:disable -->

```

<!-- cspell:enable -->

## Time to starting the website

Once `make up` has been fired and your containers in a `Up` state, our Joomla site is ready.

<Terminal>$ make up</Terminal>

You will need some information like credentials for the database; this is why the `make start` screen was defined.

Please run `make start` in console. You'll get a screen like the one below:

<Terminal>$ make start</Terminal>

```none
To start your site, please jump to http://127.0.0.1:8080

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/administrator to open your backend.

Below a summary of your current installation:

JOOMLA

  * Project name              running-joomla-in-docker
  * Version                   latest
  * Port                      8080

DATABASE

  * Host                      joomla-db
  * User name                 joomla
  * Password                  examplepass
  * Database name             joomla
  * Version                   8.4.2
  * Port                      3306
```

As you can see, the port number is `8080`; the one we've specified in our `.env` file. Simply CTRL click on the URL if your terminal support this option (otherwise, manually start your preferred web browser and navigate to the specified URL).

![Joomla installer](./images/joomla_installer.webp)

**Congratulations, you have successfully installed a fresh Joomla website using Docker!**

You'll need to configure your new fresh site. In the **Database Configuration** screen, you'll need to fill in the **Host**, the **username**, the **password** and the **database name**. This information is displayed on the console; thanks `make start`. Just use these values when prompted.

## Time for a break

<StepsCard
  title="What have we seen so far?"
  variant="remember"
  steps={[
    "Without having anything other than Docker you can install Joomla and MySQL from the command line, in the version you want;",
    "That with an `.env` file we can vary certain values ​​to allow us to have several projects on our hard drive (several Joomla sites);",
    "That with the `compose.yaml` file we tell Docker what to do to make Joomla and MySQL talk each other, and",
    "The `compose.yaml` file is valuable since it allows you to define a number of configuration variables.",
  ]}
/>

Let's go a little further.

## Advanced configuration for Joomla

The official Joomla Docker image is maintained by the Joomla community on Docker Hub: [https://hub.docker.com/\_/joomla](https://hub.docker.com/_/joomla).

You'll retrieve there a list of _tags_ i.e. a list of versions you can install using Docker but you'll also find a **How to use this image** section and that one is really useful.

Below the list of variables supported by Joomla by the end of September 2024:

| Variable name             | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `JOOMLA_DB_HOST`          | Defaults to the IP and port of the linked mysql container                                               |
| `JOOMLA_DB_USER`          | Defaults to `root`                                                                                      |
| `JOOMLA_DB_PASSWORD`      | Defaults to the value of the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable from the linked mysql container |
| `JOOMLA_DB_PASSWORD_FILE` | Path to a file containing the database password                                                         |
| `JOOMLA_DB_NAME`          | Defaults to `joomla`                                                                                    |
| `JOOMLA_DB_TYPE`          | Defaults to `mysqli`; options: `mysqli`, `pgsql`                                                        |

The following environment variables are also recognized for configuring auto deployment (i.e. skip the browser setup) for your Joomla instance:

| Variable name             | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `JOOMLA_SITE_NAME`        | Name of the Joomla site                                                  |
| `JOOMLA_ADMIN_USER`       | Full name of the Joomla administrator                                    |
| `JOOMLA_ADMIN_USERNAME`   | Username of the Joomla administrator                                     |
| `JOOMLA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`   | Password of the Joomla administrator                                     |
| `JOOMLA_ADMIN_EMAIL`      | Email address of the Joomla administrator                                |
| `JOOMLA_EXTENSIONS_URLS`  | Semicolon-separated list of URLs to install Joomla extensions from       |
| `JOOMLA_EXTENSIONS_PATHS` | Semicolon-separated list of file paths to install Joomla extensions from |
| `JOOMLA_SMTP_HOST`        | SMTP host for outgoing email                                             |
| `JOOMLA_SMTP_HOST_PORT`   | SMTP port for outgoing email                                             |

Pay attention to the last table here above.

<AlertBox variant="info" title="Pretty cool!">
We could therefore completely ignore the Joomla configuration screens!!! By specifying certain values, we could therefore install a beautiful, fresh Joomla and already display a functional website.

</AlertBox>

Let's try.

We'll update our three files to skip the installation process by predefining values like the name and the password for our administrator.

### Updated compose.yaml

We'll edit our `compose.yaml` file and add new entries:

<Snippet filename="compose.yaml" source="./files/compose_updated.yaml" />

### Updated .env

And we'll also update our `.env` file like this:

<Snippet filename=".env" source="./files/.env_updated" />

### Updated makefile

And, finally, also update the `makefile` like this:

<Snippet filename="makefile" source="./files/makefile_updated" />

As you can see, we've configured some `JOOMLA_ADMIN_xxx` keys and set `JOOMLA_SITE_NAME` to _Joomla_; the name of our website.

### Running the website and skip the installation process

Once you've updated the three files; just run `make reset` (to remove our previous site if any) then run `make up` to create a new one. Finally, run `make start` to show a list of important variables:

<Terminal>$ make reset && make up && make start</Terminal>

```none
To start your site, please jump to http://127.0.0.1:8080

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/administrator to open your backend.

Below a summary of your current installation:

JOOMLA

  * Project name              running-joomla-in-docker
  * Version                   5.2.0-php8.3-apache
  * Port                      8080

  Administration

  * Site name                 Joomla
  * Admin friendly username   Joomla Hero
  * Admin username            joomla
  * Admin password            joomla@secured
  * Admin email               joomla@example.com

DATABASE

  * Host                      joomla-db
  * Version                   8.4.2
  * Name                      joomla
  * User                      joomla
  * Password                  examplepass
  * Port                      3306
```

Now, by going to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/administrator`, you'll no more see the installation screens but, immediately, the login screen. The username to use is `joomla` and his password is `joomla@secured` (as you can see on the console).

Your Joomla site is already configured; nice no?

## Time for a second break

Ok, so right now, we've seen how to create a fresh Joomla website in seconds with just the `make up` command and how to bypass the installation screens by already providing useful information in our `.env` file.

Let's try a real-world example: we are a small web agency and we wish to use Docker for our next projects and we already have three projects in our mind. Or, you're an individual having several websites; all with different Joomla versions.

## Starting three different projects

Please create a structure like below i.e. `cd /tmp/joomla && mkdir project_1 project_2 project_3`.

<Terminal>$ cd /tmp/joomla && mkdir project_1 project_2 project_3</Terminal>

Then go back to the _Updated compose.yaml_ chapter and create the `compose.yaml` file in both the three projects' folder. Do the same for the `.env` and the `makefile`.

The same three files in the three projects folders.

At the end, you should have this structure in your `/tmp/joomla` folder:

```tree expanded=true showJSX=false debug=false title="/tmp/joomla"
├── project_1
│   ├── .env
│   ├── compose.yaml
│   └── makefile
├── project_2
│   ├── .env
│   ├── compose.yaml
│   └── makefile
└── project_3
    ├── .env
    ├── compose.yaml
    └── makefile
```

One directory by project and, again, our three files.

### Project 1 - Joomla 5.2

<AlertBox variant="info" title="Project 1 will be a Joomla 5.2">
In a very few words: we'll install Joomla 5.2 and MySQL 8.4.2.

</AlertBox>

Please configure the `project_1/.env` file with the following content.

As you can see (highlighted lines), that file is the same that the latest `.env` we've used earlier but:

- We'll set the `CONTAINER_PREFIX` to an unique value; in our example `joomla_5`,
- We need to do the same (i.e. define an unique value) for the MySQL port number; we can use the standard port `3306` for our first project but, let's use `3301` (`1` because it's our first project)
- You've understood; we'll do the same for `JOOMLA_SITE_NAME` and `PROJECT_NAME`; remain humble and opt for `Joomla_5` and `joomla5` and
- Finally, we need to define a web port number; we'll use `8081` (so our site will be available on `http://127.0.0.1:8081`).

Here is the `.env` file for **our first** project:

<Snippet filename="project_1/.env" source="./files/.env_project1" />

Go to your console and run `cd project_1` to jump in the first project's folder then `make up` to create Docker containers for project 1.

By going to `http://127.0.0.1:8081/administrator/` we've our first admin page (as you can see, the site is well called **Joomla_5** as expected).

![Our first site is running under Joomla 5.2](./images/project_1.webp)

<AlertBox variant="caution" title="">
Please really be careful to specify the port number of our project. For project 1, the port number is `8081`. As, in fact, we wished by setting the variable `WEB_PORT`.

So, to access to the first project, our URL is well `http://127.0.0.1:8081`.

</AlertBox>

### Project 2 - Joomla 4.0

<AlertBox variant="info" title="Project 1 will be a Joomla 4.0">
In a very few words: we'll install Joomla 4.0 and MySQL 5.7.37.

</AlertBox>

Please configure the `project_2/.env` with the following content. As you can see (highlighted lines), that file is the same that the latest `.env` we've used earlier but, just, we'll adjust the name of the project and the web port (so our site will be available on `http://127.0.0.1:8082`).

Do the same changes as for project 1 but just replace `1` by `2`:

<Snippet filename="project_2/.env" source="./files/.env_project2" />

Save the file and run `make up` to start the second website. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8082/administrator` and yes, we've our second site running on our machine.

<Terminal>$ make up</Terminal>

![Our two Joomla projects are running](./images/project_1_2.webp)

<AlertBox variant="info" title="Two Joomla sites having two different PHP and MySQL versions and ... no conflict!">
Did you see? We've two websites running on our computer. The first one is a Joomla 5.2 and the second one is Joomla 4.0.

If you're still awake after this long blog post, to get access to our second website, we need to go to `http://127.0.0.1:8082`.

</AlertBox>

### Project 3 - Joomla 3.5

<AlertBox variant="info" title="Project 1 will be a Joomla 3.5">
And now, you need to do some maintenance on an old J3.5 website. Let's create one on our computer.

</AlertBox>

Please now configure the `project_3/.env` with the following content.

This time, we'll use `3` as suffixes:

<Snippet filename="project_3/.env" source="./files/.env_project3" />

Save the file and run `make up && make start` to start the second website. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8082/administrator` and yes, we've our second site running on our machine.

<Terminal>$ make up && make start</Terminal>

![Our three Joomla projects are active at the same time on our development machine](./images/project_1_2_3.webp)

<AlertBox variant="info" title="Just wow no?">
Three different Joomla versions, MySQL and too PHP and no conflict at all!

In fact, nothing surprising, it's normal with Docker: everything is isolated in its own container. 😊

</AlertBox>

### Start all three projects in just one command

If I'm located in my `/tmp/joomla` folder; I can start my three projects at once like this:

<Terminal wrap={true}>
  $ cd project_1 && make up && cd ../project_2 && make up && cd ../project_3 &&
  make up
</Terminal>

Here is something you can get:

<Terminal wrap={true}>
$ cd project_1

$ make up
[+] Running 3/23
✔ Network joomla_5_network Created 0.0s
✔ Container joomla_5-db Healthy 11.5s
✔ Container joomla_5-app Started 0.4s

$ cd ../project_2

$ make up
[+] Running 3/3
✔ Network joomla_4_network Created 0.0s
✔ Container joomla_4-db Healthy 31.0s
✔ Container joomla_4-app Started 31.4s

$ cd ../project_3

$ make up
[+] Running 3/3
✔ Network joomla_3_network Created 0.0s
✔ Container joomla_3-db Healthy 62.7s
✔ Container joomla_3-app Started 61.5s

</Terminal>

### Other projects? How many sites can I have?

As we've just seen here, we can launch several Joomla projects at the same time on our machine and access them as easily as possible by varying the web port number (`8081`, `8082`, `8083`, ...).

But how many can I have? Well, that just depends on your machine.

For information, here's what I'm seeing right now on my Windows computer (I'm using Docker Desktop and WSL2).

![Docker desktop](./images/docker_desktop.webp)

As you can see, I've actually four projects: my current blog (running on Docker too) and the three Joomla projects.

If you look at the **CPU (%)** column, you can see that the projects are almost asleep. And this is normal: once the web page has been displayed, Joomla and MySQL don't requires CPU anymore. The page is displayed so they are sleeping.

For the memory, I've allocated max. 20GB to WSL/Docker and right now, my fourth project (my blog too) are eating 3.3 GB. I can thus start a lot more projects.

But? Did I need to be able to work on the three projects at the same time??? Probably not. So why not stopping f.i. the first and the third project?

In the console, just run `make stop` in folder project 1 and 3 by, running `( cd project_1 ; make stop ; cd ../project_3 ; make stop)`. We'll thus stop (not remove; just freeze and release memory) our first and third project.

<Terminal>
  $ ( cd project_1 ; make stop ; cd ../project_3 ; make stop )
</Terminal>

By looking back to Docker Desktop, we can indeed see we've earned 1GB RAM.

![The first and the third projects are released](./images/docker_desktop_stopped.webp)

<AlertBox variant="note" title="">
In our example here, we've just kept the second project so we can still work on `http://127.0.0.1:8082/` but the two other projects (`http://127.0.0.1:8081/` and `http://127.0.0.1:8083/`) won't respond anymore. We've stopped them.

Just run `make up` again in f.i. folder `project_1` to make the site back to life. Or, if you prefer the GUI, in Docker Desktop, just click on the `Start` button:

<Terminal>$ ( cd project_1 && make up )</Terminal>

## Restoring a JPA backup using Docker

At this point, you might be wondering: this is all great, but I already have a Joomla site and I'd like to take a backup of my site and restore it locally using Docker; how can I do this?

If you're indeed wondering, read the next article: [Restore a Joomla backup using Docker](/blog/docker-joomla-restore-jpa)
