![Linux - Using a progression bar in your script](/img/v2/linux_progress_bar.webp)

In my previous article; <Link to="/blog/bash-parallel-task">Linux - Take advantage of the number of CPUs you have; start concurrent jobs</Link>, we've seen how to start jobs in parallel.

The next cool thing is to show a progression bar in your console. This has a number of advantages, including a clear view of what's been done and what's still to be done, as well as an attractive interface.

Months ago, I've found this french blog post in my RSS feeds: [https://xieme-art.org/post/bash-avance-barre-de-progression/](https://xieme-art.org/post/bash-avance-barre-de-progression/) and, just, **wow!!!**

Let's play with it.

<!-- truncate -->

First, please create a new folder on your disk and jump it that folder: `mkdir /tmp/progress && cd $_`.

Then, create a `demo.sh` file in the folder and copy/paste the bash script below:

<Snippet filename="demo.sh" source="./files/demo.sh" />

Make the script executable by running `chmod +x ./demo.sh`.

As you can see, we'll run a function 50 times. There are three things we need to do:

1. We need to source the `progress_bar.sh` script ([credits to ephase](https://xieme-art.org/post/bash-avance-barre-de-progression/));
2. We need to run our `main` function in a specific way; not just `main` but `main > >(progress_bar::process "Doing some stuff" 50)`. The figure `50` should be set to our number of occurrences; in our example, we'll run our function 50 times so...
3. and finally, we should just output one thing to the console using `echo` and that thing should be `Progress=` followed by a number (from 1 till 50). In our example, we'll simply pass our `i` variable as a function parameter to achieve this need.

Not so difficult, right?

## Let's create the progress_bar.sh script

Please click on the accordion below to reveal the content you'll need to copy/paste in a file called `progress_bar.sh` that you need to create in the same folder than the `demo.sh` one.

Please create a new file on your hard disk; name it `progress_bar.sh` and copy/paste the content below in it.

<Snippet filename="progress_bar.sh" source="./files/progress_bar.sh" />

## Time to run the code

Simply return to the console and run `./demo.sh` and... wow; that's pretty cool.

In a real-life example, I've implement this feature in a Bash script where I need to read a CSV file and for each record retrieved in the file, I need to do run a `curl` statement for calling a RestFull POST API and upload a PDF.

And, when started in an interactive way, the screen output is really practical and terribly effective.

Of course, I'm also using a log file where I redirect a maximum number of information's.
