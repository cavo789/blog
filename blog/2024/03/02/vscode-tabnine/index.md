Tabnine is a **MUST HAVE** extension. He will predict your next keystroke and sometimes it's just **WOW; HOW IS IT POSSIBLE?**.

Imagine you've a `private string $firstName` property in PHP. By starting to type `private function set`, Tabnine will understand you're *probably* creating a setter and will then suggest `setFirstName(string $firstname)`.

<Snippet filename="customer.php" source="./files/customer.php" />

Another example...

Imagine the code below and take a look on the `__construct` method. We need to handle the `$price` parameter. We need to call the setter for it.

<Snippet filename="product.php" source="./files/product.php" />

And here is how VSCode will predict my keystrokes when Tabnine is enabled. As you can see, Tabnine will predict that, after I've typed `$this-` that I'll use my `setProductPrice` method. And he knows that this function requires a parameter so he suggests that I use my `$price` one.

It's really amazing.

By default, Tabnine works offline i.e. don't use any cloud data provider like what GitHub Copilot does.
