![Show Bluesky comments on Docusaurus and, too, number of likes/reposts](/img/bluesky_banner.jpg)

In a [previous article](/blog/docusaurus-bluesky-share), we've seen how we can, simply said, provide a "Share the article on Bluesky".

This is not really interactive right? Let's see in this article how to make the link between a Docusaurus blog post and Bluesky.

<!-- truncate -->

<StepsCard
  title="The workflow will be:"
  variant="steps"
  steps={[
    'You publish your article on your blog,',
    'You share the article on Bluesky (by using the "Share the article" feature of course),',
    'You retrieve the **Bluesky Record key** i.e. the very last part of Bluesky post URL (something like `3lun2qjuxc22r`),',
    'You edit back your Docusaurus article and you add a key in your YAML front matter (the YAML block at the top of your article). The key to add is `blueskyRecordKey: xxxx` where `xxxx` is your **Bluesky Record key**.',
    'You publish your updated article on your blog again.'
  ]}
/>

So, from now, you've clearly make the link between your article and your Bluesky post.

<StepsCard
  title="Thanks to this link, we can:"
  variant="steps"
  steps={[
    'Display a button "Like, share or comment on Bluesky": the visitor can then jump to your Bluesky post and like, share or comment your article,',
    'Display the number of likes and reposts below your article and,',
    'Display the list of comments you\'ve received on your Bluesky post and, if none, display a *Call to action* area to encourage your reader to share his thoughts'
  ]}
/>

In the previous article (see [Create our own Docusaurus React component and provide a "Share on Bluesky" button](/blog/docusaurus-bluesky-share)), we've created the `src/components/Bluesky/index.js` file. Please edit that file and use this new content:

## 1/5 The layout of our Bluesky generic component

Here is our new Bluesky layout for our component:

<Snippet filename="src/components/Bluesky/index.js" source="src/components/Bluesky/index.js" />

:::info
The highlighted lines are the new ones compared of the previous version of the file if you've already followed the first tutorial.

<StepsCard
  title="As you can see, this time, we'll foresee four components:"
  variant="steps"
  steps={[
    'A Share button,',
    'A Post button (to jump to your post on Bluesky),',
    'A likes area (to show the number of likes and reposts of your post on Bluesky) and',
    'An area for displaying comments you\'ve on Bluesky'
  ]}
/>

## 2/5 Our "Like, share or comment" button

<Snippet filename="src/components/Bluesky/post.js" source="src/components/Bluesky/post.js" />

## 3/5 Our component for getting the number of likes and reposts

<Snippet filename="src/components/Bluesky/likes.js" source="src/components/Bluesky/likes.js" />

## 4/5 Retrieving all comments

<Snippet filename="src/components/Bluesky/comments.js" source="src/components/Bluesky/comments.js" />

## 5/5 Our new CSS

<Snippet filename="src/components/Bluesky/styles.module.css" source="src/components/Bluesky/styles.module.css" />

## Update the Docusaurus configuration file

We're almost done. In order to be able to retrieve likes, shares and comments from your Bluesky account, you've to tell to the component your Bluesky handle.

You've to edit the `docusaurus.config.js` file and add a new section called `customFields` as illustrated below:

<Snippet filename="docusaurus.config.js">

```js
const config = {
  // [...]
  customFields: {
    bluesky: {
      // This is the Bluesky handle as displayed in your Bluesky profile page
      handle: "avonture.be",
    },
  },
  // [...]
};
```

</Snippet>

For sure, use yours; not mine ;-)
