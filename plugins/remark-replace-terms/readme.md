# remark-replace-terms

A Docusaurus-friendly [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) plugin that automatically corrects the casing of common tech terms in Markdown files. Ideal for ensuring consistent branding across your documentation.

## 🚀 What It Does

This plugin scans Markdown content and replaces lowercase variants of specific keywords with their correctly capitalized forms:

| Incorrect | Correct |
| --- | --- |
| github | GitHub |
| markdown | Markdown |
| docusaurus | Docusaurus |
| vscode | VSCode |

It avoids replacements in:

* Code blocks and inline code
* Links and image alt text
* Compound words like `github.io` or `markdown-parser`

## 🧩 Installation

Make sure your project uses React and Docusaurus 3.x. Then place the plugin in your desired location:

```bash
plugins/remark-replace-terms/remarkReplaceTerms
```

Then add the plugin to your `docusaurus.config.js` file:

```js
const config = {
  // [ ... ]
  presets: [
    [
      'classic',
      ({
        blog: {
          // highlight-next-line
          remarkPlugins: [require('./plugins/remark-replace-terms/remarkReplaceTerms')],
        },
        // [ ... ]
      }),
    ],
  ],
};

export default config;

```

## 🛠️ Customization

You can modify the replacements array in the plugin to include additional terms:

```js
const replacements = [
  [/\bdocusaurus\b/g, "Docusaurus"],
  [/\bgithub\b/g, "GitHub"],
  [/\bmarkdown\b/g, "Markdown"],
  [/\bvscode\b/g, "VSCode"],
];
```
