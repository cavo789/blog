# ascii-injector

A small Docusaurus plugin that injects an ASCII-art banner into generated HTML pages during the `postBuild` step.

## Features

* Injects an ASCII banner as an HTML comment immediately after the `<!doctype ...>` line (default).
* Safe fallback behavior when files do not contain a DOCTYPE or `<body>` tag.

## Usage

1. Place the plugin folder under `plugins/ascii-injector/` and ensure `index.mjs` exists (this repo contains the implementation).
2. Add a banner file in your site, for example `src/data/banner.txt` (UTF-8 text).
3. Register the plugin in `docusaurus.config.js`:

```js
{
  // ... other config
  plugins: [
    ['ascii-injector', { bannerPath: 'src/data/banner.txt' }],
  ],
};
```

## Options

* `bannerPath` (string, required): path relative to your site root (`siteDir`) to the ASCII text file.

## Behavior details

* Files are processed during `postBuild` on the generated `outDir` HTML files; because builds freshly generate the HTML, duplicated insertion is not a concern.

## Testing

Build your site and inspect a generated page source:

```bash
yarn docusaurus build
yarn docusaurus serve
# open a page in the browser and press CTRL+U (View Page Source)
```

## Notes

* The plugin reads the banner file as UTF-8. Use a plain text ASCII file for best results.
* The plugin performs per-file updates on the generated HTML — keep backups if you have post-processing tooling that relies on a specific order.
