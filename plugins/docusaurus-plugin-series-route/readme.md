# docusaurus-plugin-series-route

## Purpose

This plugin adds dynamic routing support to your Docusaurus site for blog series pages.

By default, Docusaurus does not support dynamic URL parameters like `/series/:slug`.

This plugin programmatically registers a route matching `/series/:slug` and loads a React component that fetches and displays blog articles belonging to the specified series slug.

## How it works

* The plugin uses Docusaurus's `contentLoaded` lifecycle to add a custom route.
* The route matches `/series/:slug`.
* When a user visits a URL like `/series/my-series-name`, the plugin loads the React component located at `src/components/Blog/Series/SeriesArticlesPage.js`.
* This component receives the `slug` parameter and renders the articles that belong to that series.

## Setup

1. Place the plugin code in your Docusaurus `plugins/docusaurus-plugin-series-route/index.cjs`.
2. Register the plugin in your `docusaurus.config.js` under `plugins`:

   ```js
   import pluginSeriesRoute from "./plugins/docusaurus-plugin-series-route/index.cjs"
   // [...]
   plugins: [
     // [...]
     [pluginSeriesRoute, {}],
   ],
   ```

3. Create the React component `SeriesArticlesPage.js` at `src/components/Blog/Series/` to fetch and display series articles based on the slug.

## Benefits

* Clean, dynamic URLs for series pages (e.g. `/series/coding-using-a-devcontainer`).
* Easy to manage and extend series-related functionality.
* Keeps series routing logic separated from other app routes.
