My name is **Christophe Avonture**, a passionate developer based in [Racour](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racour), Belgium.

With an insatiable curiosity, I devote a large part of my life to programming, exploring open source, and sharing knowledge, whether through projects, articles, or exchanges within tech communities.

For years, I have been actively contributing to the Joomla ecosystem, both in Belgium and in the [French-speaking](https://forum.joomla.fr/member/38299-cavo789) world: participating in the organization of [JoomlaDays](https://www.joomladay.fr/?view=article&id=56:christophe-avonture&catid=17), writing articles for tje [Joomla Community Magazine](https://magazine.joomla.org/), developing extensions now obsoletes (SportingEvents & AllEvents) and sharing tutorials.

In addition, Docker plays now a central role in my daily life since four years. I enjoy popularizing its use: creating tutorials, leading sessions, but also building reproducible environments so that developers can work more efficiently. I also explore modern tools such as Dagger.io to refine and automate my CI.CD workflows.

I place vital importance on code quality. For me, it goes without saying that code should work, but it must also be clean, optimized, well formatted and documented, and refactored every time you can. Code should always reflect the best of your skills.

        In terms of achievements, I have published a lot of open source projects, mainly in PHP or related to automation (VBS and VBA scripts for Excel, [MarkNotes](https://github.com/cavo789/marknotes), a Markdown note management, guide for Visual Studio Code, etc.). My GitHub repository ([cavo789](https://github.com/cavo789)) includes [Excel macro export scripts](https://github.com/cavo789/vba_excel_export_code), [aeSecure QuickScan](https://github.com/cavo789/aesecure_quickscan) a PHP file scanning tools to detect viruses, solutions to improve productivity in VSCode, and ways to simplify Markdown note-taking.

        My blog reflects my desire to share: I post tips, tutorials, feedback on the tools I test, and thoughts on the world of development. My goal is to help other enthusiasts progress, avoid common pitfalls, or simply exchange ideas about a shared passion.

        Finally, community is essential to me: whether on GitHub, forums ([Joomla](https://forum.joomla.fr/member/38299-cavo789), [Docker](https://forums.docker.com/u/cavo789/summary), ...), or at events, I enjoy learning from others, sharing my experience, and contributing to an open, collaborative, and stimulating tech environment.

        * `AllEvents`: Successor of SportingEvents, I created this events extension for Joomla!, enabling advanced management of online events and calendars. I transferred ownership of the extension to a friend who ensured its evolution to Joomla 3 and 4.
        * `aeSecure`: I developed this web-application firewall (WAF), widely used to secure Joomla! sites. aeSecure offers different versions and includes the “QuickScan” antivirus scan to detect malicious files. Many professionals have adopted it as an essential protection solution. Now the maintenance of QuickScan is ensured by the French Joomla Users community.
        * `Marknotes`: Passionate about productivity tools, I developed Marknotes, an open-source application for efficiently organizing, searching, and managing Markdown notes, designed for demanding users and knowledge management enthusiasts.
