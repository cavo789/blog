I am passionate about the world of Open Source, programming since now almost 30+ years in so much languages that I can not remember all.

Over the last few years, I've been focusing more on web development ([php](/blog/tags/php)) and I've developed a taste for devOps, creating lots of scripts, procedures and workflows for myself and my team.

I am in love with technologies like [WSL](/blog/tags/wsl) and [Docker](/blog/tags/docker).

Also an expert in VBA - Excel that I have been practicing for more than twenty years.
