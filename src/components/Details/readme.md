# 📘 Details Component

A reusable React component for Docusaurus that wraps the native `<details>` and `<summary>` HTML elements. It provides a clean, accessible way to display collapsible content blocks—ideal for FAQs, tips, or expandable sections in documentation.

## 📦 Installation

Make sure your project uses React and Docusaurus 3.x. Then place the component in your desired location:

```bash
src/components/Details/index.js
src/components/Details/styles.module.css
```

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Native HTML semantics for accessibility
* 🎨 Styled with CSS Modules and Docusaurus alert classes
* 🧩 Accepts custom label and children content
* 🛠️ PropTypes for type safety

## 🧪 Usage

```jsx
import Details from '@site/src/components/Details';

<Details label="What is this component?">
  <p>This is a collapsible section using native HTML elements.</p>
</Details>
```

## 🧾 Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- |  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `label` | string | ✅ | — | Text shown in the summary heading |
| `children` | node | ✅ | — | Content to render inside the collapsible area |

## 🎨 Styling

This component uses:

* CSS Modules (`styles.module.css`)
* Docusaurus alert classes (alert alert--info) for consistent theming
* You can customize the appearance by editing `styles.module.css` or overriding styles in your global CSS.

## 🧠 Notes

This component is internal to your Docusaurus site—no installation required.

It uses native <details> behavior, so it works well across modern browsers.

For advanced styling (e.g. animated expand/collapse), consider wrapping the content in a div and applying transitions manually.
