# 🧮 BlogPostCount Component

A React component for Docusaurus that displays the total number of published blog posts. Great for giving readers a quick snapshot of your blog’s activity and encouraging deeper engagement.

## 🚀 Features

* 📊 Counts only published (non-draft) blog posts
* 🧼 Filters out drafts automatically
* 🧩 Easy to integrate into any Docusaurus page
* 🗣️ Friendly and customizable message

## Example

Here’s what the component looks like out-of-the-box:

```html
We have published 42 articles on our blog!
```

## 📦 Installation

Place the component in your Docusaurus project:

```bash
src/components/Blog/PostCount/index.js
```

Ensure you have a `getBlogMetadata()` utility that returns blog metadata including draft status. To do this, simply do this: `import { getBlogMetadata } from "@site/src/components/Blog/utils/posts";`.

## 🧪 Usage

```jsx
import BlogPostCount from "@site/src/components/Blog/PostCount";

<BlogPostCount />
```

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Docusaurus v3+
* Blog metadata utility: getBlogMetadata()
* Blog posts must include a draft field (boolean)

## 🎨 Styling

The component uses a simple `<p>` tag with a `<strong>` element for emphasis. You can easily override styles using your own CSS or wrap it in a custom layout.
