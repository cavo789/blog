# 📚 SeriesCards Component

Displays a grid of blog article series as clickable cards.

Each card links to a dedicated series page and shows the number of published and draft articles.

## 📦 Location

Place the component in your Docusaurus project:

```bash
src/components/Blog/SeriesCards/index.js
```

## ✨ Features

* Automatically groups blog posts by their `series` field
* Shows:
  * Series title
  * Featured image (with fallback)
  * Summary of published and draft articles
* Responsive layout using Docusaurus Infima grid
* Graceful fallback when no series are found

## 🚀 Usage

```jsx
import SeriesCards from '@site/src/components/Blog/SeriesCards';

Discover our collections of articles organized by theme.

Each series offers you a progressive learning path to master a specific area of web development.

<SeriesCards />
```

## 🧩 Dependencies

* `generateSeriesList` from `src/components/Blog/utils/series.js`
* `PostCard` component for rendering individual cards (`src/components/Blog/PostCard/index.js`)

## 🛠️ Customization

To customize the permalink structure or fallback image, modify the `generateSeriesList` call:

```js
const seriesList = generateSeriesList(posts, '/series/articles', '/img/fallback.jpg');
```

## 🧠 Notes

* Series are sorted alphabetically
* The first post in each series (chronologically) is used to represent the series visually
* Drafts are counted but not linked

## 🧪 Example Output

Each card includes:

* Title: `Introduction to Docusaurus`
* Image: `/img/docusaurus-intro.png`
* Description: `5 published article(s) • 2 in progress`
* Link: `/series/introduction-to-docusaurus`
