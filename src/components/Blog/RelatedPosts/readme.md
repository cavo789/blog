# 🔗 RelatedPosts Component

A React component for Docusaurus that displays a grid of related blog posts based on shared tags or a designated `mainTag`. Perfect for keeping readers engaged and guiding them through thematically connected content.

* 🧠 Smart filtering by `mainTag` or fallback to shared tags
* 🧹 Excludes the current post from results
* 🎲 Randomizes post order for variety
* 📦 Configurable post count
* 📝 Optional description display
* 📅 Shows post date
* 🖼️ Displays post image if available

## Example

Out-of-the-box, here is how the component will looks like:

## 📦 Installation

Place the component in your Docusaurus project:

```bash
src/components/RelatedPosts/RelatedPosts.js
```

Ensure you have a `getBlogMetadata()` utility that returns blog metadata including `title`, `date`, `tags`, `mainTag`, `description`, `image` and `permalink`.

## 🧪 Usage

```jsx
import RelatedPosts from "@site/src/components/RelatedPosts";

<RelatedPosts count={3} description={true} />
```

## 🧾 Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `count` | number | ❌ | `3` | Maximum number of related posts to display |
| `description` | boolean | ❌ | false | Whether to show post descriptions if available |

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Docusaurus v3+
* Blog metadata utility: `getBlogMetadata()`
* Blog posts must include `tags`, `mainTag`, `title`, `date`, `permalink` and optionally `description` and `image`

## 🎨 Styling

Uses Docusaurus grid and card classes. Inline styles are applied for:

* Card layout and spacing
* Image sizing and border radius
* Typography and color accents

You can override styles using your own CSS or classNames.
