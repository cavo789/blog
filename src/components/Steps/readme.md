| `title` | string | "Steps to follow" | Optional title displayed above the steps list. |

## 🧪 Markdown Support

Supports basic Markdown formatting in strings:

* `**bold**` → `<strong>`
* `inline code` → `<code>`

## 🎨 Styling

The component uses scoped CSS via `styles.module.css` and Docusaurus theme variables:

## 🧩 MDX Compatibility

Steps can be passed as React nodes for full MDX flexibility. If passed as strings, they are rendered with basic Markdown support.
