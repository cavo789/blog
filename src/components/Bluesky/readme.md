# 🟦 Bluesky Component

The `Bluesky` component is a dynamic integration for Docusaurus pages that enables interaction with the [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) social platform. Depending on the presence of a `blueskyRecordKey` in the document's frontmatter, it either allows visitors to share the page on their own Bluesky profile or interact with an existing post (like, repost, comment).

## ✨ Features

* 🔗 Share button for posting the current document to a user's Bluesky profile
* 💬 Like, repost, and comment interface for existing Bluesky posts
* 📊 Displays number of likes and reposts
* 🗨️ Shows comments or engagement call-to-action
* 🧠 Behavior determined by frontmatter configuration

## Example

Out-of-the-box, here is how the component will looks like:

![Example](sample.png)

## 📦 Usage

### 1. Add Frontmatter to Your Document

To enable full post interaction (likes, comments, etc.), include a `blueskyRecordKey` in your document's frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "My Awesome Post"
blueskyRecordKey: 3lun2qjuxc22r
---
```

If `blueskyRecordKey` is omitted or empty, only the share button will be shown.

### 2. Configure Your Bluesky Handle

In your `docusaurus.config.js`, add your Bluesky handle under customFields:

```js
const config = {
  // ...
  customFields: {
    bluesky: {
      handle: 'avonture.be', // Replace with your actual Bluesky handle
    },
  },
};
```

## 🧪 Example

```jsx
import Bluesky from "@site/src/components/Bluesky";

<Bluesky metadata={props.metadata} />
```

## 🧾 Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `metadata | object | ✅ | — | Docusaurus document metadata, including frontmatter |
| `metadata.frontMatter.blueskyRecordKey`| string | ❌ | — | Unique key for the associated Bluesky post. Enables full interaction mode. |

## 🔀 Behavior

| Scenario | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| `blueskyRecordKey` is absent | Shows a share button to post the document to user's Bluesky profile |
| `blueskyRecordKey` is present | Displays post interaction UI: like, repost, comment, and engagement data |
